<p class="style1 style1">This part of the guide will show you how to record Soundfonts
  in an ASIO host, using Logic as an example. </p>
<p class="style1 style1"><u>Notes:</u><br>
  The ASIO host I will use in this guide is Logic. If you have any problems configuring a different ASIO host, please search the <a href="http://www.driverheaven.net/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=67" target="new">kX Forums.</a><br>
  Certain Soundblaster Live 5.1 Models, SB0060 & SB010x, have ASIO mapping errors,
  ie the ASIO inputs on the epilog in the DSP do not match up with the ASIO inputs
  in the host, and as I have one of these cards, I will show you the steps on
  how to bypass this, but for users of different cards, those steps will be marked
  with a "*" and
  are optional. </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This setup was carried out
    on Windows XP Professional with a custom theme, so don't be alarmed if the
    message boxes look a little wierd or some don't pop up.</font></p>
<p class="style1 style1"><u><b>Soundfont Window</b></u>&nbsp;<br>
  <img src="pic/mixer-sf.gif" width="600" height="340"></p>
<p class="style1 style1">To record a soundfont, first you have to load one. <br>
  <img src="pic/sfrec-sfl.gif" width="600" height="340">  <br>
  Click
  on the plus symbol (+) and then navigate to a soundfont file.<br>
  The load the soundfont.
  <br>
  <img src="pic/sfrec-sfl2.gif" width="600" height="340"><br>
  Select Both Synths in the dropdown menu </p>
<p class="style1 style1"><u><b>Routing</b></u></p>
<p class="style1">
The router window is where each software output is mapped to the FXBus in the
  DSP, to be routed to a physical output.
  <br>
  <img src="pic/mixer-router.gif" width="450" height="366">
<p class="style1">As Synth2 is the default soundfont , I will check the settings
  for Synth2 <br>
  <img src="pic/sfrec-router.gif" width="450" height="355"><br>The two numbers
  circled are the two fxbus channels that Synth2 uses as it's output.<br>
  <br>To get this working in an ASIO host, you need to map this to an ASIO channel
  in the DSP<br>
  <img src="pic/sfrec-dsp.gif" width="800" height="599"> <br>
  The two red lines
  represent the routing you should have (it does not matter which ASIO stereo
  channel you choose).<br>
  To create a &quot;wire&quot; between an output and an input, hold the mouse button over
  the output, then drag over until the mouse is over the input you wish to connect
  to, then release the mouse. The wire should now be in place. <br>
<p class="style1">Note: In some ASIO hosts, ASIO inputs 4/5 may be called 5/6
  due to the count starting from 1 instead of 0 as is the case with kX. 
<p class="style1">  Now it is time to load your ASIO host program. I will use Logic version 5.5.1 <br>
    Note: This procedure will be different for each ASIO host sequencer, if you
    know enough about the sequencer you have, read this section and try to setup
    your sequencer. If you cannot do this search the <a href="http://www.driverheaven.net/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=67" target="new">kX
    Forums</a> for an answer.<br>
    <br>
    In the Audio Driver setup window<br>
    <img src="pic/sfrec-lasio.gif" width="450" height="355">  
  <p class="style1">Make sure that you ASIO device is kX ASIO Driver and that it
  is active.<br>
  Click the control panel button&hellip;<br>
  <img src="pic/rec-asio.gif" width="285" height="201"><br>
&hellip;and make sure that the samplerate is 48000hz (48khz), otherwise you will
not be able to record.  <br>
  <br>
  Then select a Midi channel in the arrange window<br>
  <img src="pic/sfrec-lms.gif" width="214" height="224">  <br>
  And select Synth2 as the Midi Driver <br>
  <br>
  <img src="pic/sfrec-loop.gif" width="600" height="340">
<p class="style1">(*)Write a simple Midi tune in the Midi channel, and set it
  to loop, you should then hear a soundfont playing.<br>
  <br>
  Open the track mixer and select an Audio Channel<br>
  <img src="pic/sfrec-ac1.gif" width="67" height="442"> -&gt;<img src="pic/sfrec-ac2.gif" width="67" height="442">  <br>
  Click the mono/stereo switch as shown<br>
  <img src="pic/sfrec-ac3.gif" width="67" height="442"> 
<p class="style1">As you can see, the default inputs are channels 1 &amp; 2, which
  is where we routed the soundfont output to,but for users of card models SB0060
  &amp; SB010x, this may not be the case.<br>
  (*)Press play on the transport, and
  see if there is level shown in the peakmeter for Audio 1, if not try a new
  stereo pair of inputs until you find one with level<br>

<p class="style1">You have now learnt how to record Soundfonts in an ASIO host.<br>
