<p class="style1">The <a href="http://www.driverheaven.net/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=67">kX
    Forums</a> exist as a place for people to discuss issues,
  problems and suggestions relating to the <a href="http://www.kxproject.com">kX Project
  Drivers</a>.</p>
<p class="style1">Note: Although the forum is a place to ask questions, there
  is a certain standard of behaviour that you should adhere to:<br>
  No abuse or swearing<br>
  Being polite and patient<br>
  Not making demands on the kX Team (They are doing this for free) <br>
  and searching the forums for answers before posting questions</p>
<p class="style1">The first to points there need no explanation, and as for not
  making demands, the kX Team are doing this for free for your benefit, and may
  have jobs and other matters to take care of before working on the kX Project.</p>
<p class="style1">The fourth point is a courtesy to forum members, the senior
  members of the forum can get quite annoyed if the same question is posted again
  and again&hellip; that is one of the reasons that made me start this guide.</p>
<p class="style1">So please use the search function of the forum for an answer
  if possible, and if you can't find an answer then post your question, then
  either of the kX Developers, myself or the other members of the forum will
  answer your question as soon as they can.</p>
<p class="style1">That also goes two ways, if someone asks a question that you
  know the answer to, please take the time to post a reply, the kX Forums probably
  wouln't be where they are today, or even exist at all, if people did not take
  the time to help other members.</p>
<p class="style1">The forums are not run by the kX team, but are part of a seperate
  forum on <a href="www.driverheaven.net">Driverheaven.net</a>, as such any issues
  about signing up and logging in should be directed at the administrators there,
  not at the kX Team.</p>
<p class="style1">This is what the title bar of Driverheaven looks like&hellip;<br>

  the steps to become a member<br>

  you may be having.</p>
<p class="style1"><img src="pic/forum1.gif" width="722" height="385"><br>
  This is the list of forums you can post in relating to the kX Project.</p>
<p class="style1"><b>General Discussion</b> is where you post suggestions, general
  issues and information relating to kX. New version announcements  will be posted
  here. <br>

  where you ask question specifically about the DSP and effects, and visit often
  as people who write DSP modules will post links in here.<br>

  issues are discussed.<br>

  <b>In Russian</b> is the Russian kX forum </p>
<p class="style1">If you find that the answers provided help you solve your solution,
  please reply in the forum so we know what we are saying is right, and if you
  did anything differently, please say that as well so that other members can
  benefit from your experience.</p>
<p class="style1">Last but not least, please find the time to thank the kX Project
  Developers for the kX Drivers, and those members of the forum that helped you
  with your problem. </p>
<p class="style1">Remember the kX Forums are a friendly place and members are
  encouraged to post links to music they have made and to help others with troubles
  - without these forums I would have been lost with kX. </p>
