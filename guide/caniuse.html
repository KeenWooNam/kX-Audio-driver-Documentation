      Project Frequently Asked Questions Page</a>.<br>
    <br>
&quot;The kX driver conforms to the WDM (Windows Driver Model)
    specification and is therefore compatible with the following Microsoft Windows
    operating systems: Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows 98 (Second Edition only),
    and Windows Me. Windows .NET Server 2003 may also be supported, however,
this has not been tested. Windows 98 (First Edition) will not be supported since
  it has no built-in support for WDM drivers (v1.1 or later).&quot;</a></p>
<p class="style1">One kX user has tested kX to be compatible with the Windows Longhorn Beta,
