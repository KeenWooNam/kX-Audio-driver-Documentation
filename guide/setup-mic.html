  <p>This part of the guide will show you how to set
      up the microphone for use in MME sound programs, such as SoundForge, and
      programs such as Teamspeak.</font></p>
  <font face="arial"><p>
One of the most common problems mentioned in the <a href="http://www.driverheaven.net/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=67" target="new">kX
Project Forums</a> is that the microphone does not work in a given program.<br>This
section of the guide is designed to help you make the microphone work.
<p>Lets start with the AC-97 page of the kX Mixer<br>

<p>You can see here how it may become a little confusing.
<p>In the following pic i have shown you what the AC-97 page should look like
  to get the microphone working.
<p><img src="pic/mic-ac97.gif" width="600" height="340">
<p>1. This drop down box is where you choose what input you want to record from,
  set this to &quot;Mic&quot;<br>2. There will be no sound if the mic is muted,
  so make sure that the small circle is blue (un-muted) and that the slider is
  up until the number above it says &quot;0&quot;<br>3. The microphone boost
  amplifies the microphone signal by 20dB if it was not loud enough, and that
  is why the box above the mic says &quot;20&quot; 
<p>Now the AC-97 Page is setup, lets move to the Record Window<br>
  <img src="pic/mixer-rec.gif" width="600" height="340">
<p>This is not setup by default to use the microphone, so lets fix this.<br>

</font>
  <p><font face="arial">1. The first step in this window, and that is to unmute
      the AC-97 input, and to set the level to &quot;0&quot; (Clicking the little
      arrow on the side will automatically set the level to &quot;0&quot;)
      <br>
      2. Make sure you mute the &quot;Wave Recording Level&quot; as that will record everything
      that you hear through the speakers, and will often cause echoing in your
  recordings</font>  
  <p><font face="arial">Now to the Ins &amp; Outs Page<br>
    <img src="pic/mixer-io.gif" width="600" height="340"> <br>
    We need to unmute the AC-97 Slider&hellip;<br>
    <img src="pic/aurec-io.gif" width="600" height="340"> <br>
    &hellip;and set the level to maximum.</font>
  <font face="arial"><p>Now the microphone should work <br>
