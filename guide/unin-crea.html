  Soundblaster drivers that came with you soundcard.</p>
<p class="style1">Note: This guide was based on Windows XP with a custom theme,

  click &quot;Change/Remove&quot; and follow the instructions to uninstall. You may need
  to reboot your computer after this process. </p>
<p class="style1">These instructions show the kX driver already installed,
  but the process is the same for most hardware.</p>

  Device Manager.</p>
<p class="style1">When prompted to restart, click &quot;OK&quot; to restart immediately,
  and &quot;Cancel&quot; to restart in your own time. </p>
<p class="style1">Once you have restarted, a popup window may appear stating
  that new hardware was found. If prompted to install anything click &quot;Cancel.&quot; </p>
<p class="style1">If there are conflicts and errors occuring after installing
  the kX Project Drivers, first try the <a href="http://www.kxproject.com/xp.php">Windows
  2000/XP Setup Guide</a>.</p>
