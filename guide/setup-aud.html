<p>This part of the guide will show you how to record Audio from the &quot;Line
  In&quot; or
  &quot;Mic&quot; ports on your soundcard, using Logic as an example.</p>
<p>Note: This procedure will be different for each ASIO host sequencer, if you
  know enough about the sequencer you have, read this section and try to setup
  your sequencer. If you cannot do this search the <a href="http://www.driverheaven.net/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=67" target="new">kX
  Forums</a> for an answer.</p>
<p>  <span class="style1 style1">Certain Soundblaster Live 5.1 Models, SB0060 & SB010x,
    have ASIO mapping errors, ie the ASIO inputs on the epilog in the DSP do not
    match up with the ASIO inputs in the host, and as I have one of these cards,
    I will show you the steps on how to bypass this, but for users of different
    cards, those steps will be marked with a "*" and are optional. </span></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">his installation was carried out
    on Windows XP Professional with a custome theme, so don't be alarmed if the
  message boxes look a little wierd or some don't pop up.</font></p>
<p>Lets open up the AC-97 Page<br>
  <img src="pic/mic-ac97.gif" width="600" height="340">  <br>
  This guide will focus on recording from the Mic(2), if you need to record from
  Line In, substitute &quot;Line In&quot; in the &quot;Record From&quot; dropdown menu (1)<br>
  Don't forget to unmute Line In if you are using it</p>
<p>    Now go to the Ins &amp; Outs Page<br>
  <img src="pic/aurec-io.gif" width="600" height="340"><br>
  Unmute 
  and raise the level of the AC-97 Slider <br> 
    <br>
    Open up the DSP window.<br>
    <img src="pic/dsp-basic.gif" width="800" height="599"><br>
    You can see that all prolog inputs are also routed to ASIO channels, but we
    need to know which channels we are using. <br>

    The AC-97 Channels route to&hellip;<br>
    <img src="pic/aurec-epl.gif" width="99" height="377"><img src="pic/aurec-epr.gif" width="99" height="377"><br>
  ASIO 4/5 In the epilog.</p>
<p>Note: In some ASIO hosts, ASIO inputs 4/5 may be called 5/6 due to the count
  starting from 1 instead of 0 as is the case with kX. </p>
<p>Connect your microphone or line in source (such as a synthesizer) to the correct
  jack. See <a href="hardinst.html#line">here</a> for details on how to do this if you do not know how.</p>
<p class="style1">Now it is time to load your ASIO host program. I will use Logic
  version 5.5.1 <br>
  Note: This procedure will be different for each ASIO host sequencer, if you
  know enough about the sequencer you have, read this section and try to setup
  your sequencer. If you cannot do this search the <a href="http://www.driverheaven.net/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=67" target="new">kX
  Forums</a> for an answer.<br>
      <br>
  In the Audio Driver setup window<br>
  <img src="pic/sfrec-lasio.gif" width="450" height="355">
<p class="style1">Make sure that you ASIO device is kX ASIO Driver and that it
  is active.<br>
  Click the control panel button&hellip;<br>
  <img src="pic/rec-asio.gif" width="285" height="201"><br>
  &hellip;and make sure that the samplerate is 48000hz (48khz), otherwise you will not
  be able to record. <br>
</p>
<p class="style1">Open the track mixer&hellip;<br>
    <img src="pic/sfrec-ac1.gif" width="67" height="442">-&gt;<img src="pic/sfrec-ac2.gif" width="67" height="442"><br>
    Select the first audio track and if you are using a stereo line in source,
    set the audio channel to Stereo by clicking the Stereo/Mono switch.<br>
    <img src="pic/aurec-ac1.gif" width="67" height="442"><br>
  Change the input to input 5/6<br>
  <img src="pic/aurec-ac2.gif" width="67" height="442"><br>
  And press the &quot;REC&quot; button.</p>
<p class="style1">If you cannot see level in the peak metre when speaking into
  the Mic or sending audio to the Line In, check whether the kX Router and DSP
  are correct. </p>
<p class="style1">*Or change inputs until you find level in the peak metre<br>
  <img src="pic/sfrec-ac5.gif" width="67" height="442">  <br>
  <br>
  Now you can record using the Transport<br>
